# Ideation

Ideation is a simple and intuitive collaborative idea management tool.  Necessity is the mother of invention when it comes to filling a need. Here we wanted to have a tool that would be browser based and provide real-time updates and dashboarding.

## Technology

The application will be constructed using HTML5, JQuery, Underscore, Q, CSS3, Flot, DataTables, Krajee Plugins, Node JS, Express, Ajax and Socket IO.

Node will be used with Express to present a set of simple REST interfaces to the client. The client will be a single page web application.
